**Plant Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**:

The project aims to develop an accurate and efficient machine learning model for detecting and classifying plant diseases from leaf images. By leveraging advanced image processing and deep learning techniques, the system facilitates early disease detection, which helps in reducing crop loss and enhancing agricultural productivity.

**Model Development**: Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow, with 7.8 million parameters, trained on a Kaggle dataset. Achieved a validation accuracy of 97.3% and a training accuracy of 99.5%, ensuring reliable automated detection and precise classification of various plant diseases.

**Data and Testing**: Utilized a Kaggle dataset consisting of 17,572 images across 38 disease categories. Implemented image preprocessing and augmentation techniques to enhance model performance. Tested the model on sample images, providing accurate predictions and visual feedback.

**Evaluation and Visualization**: Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for evaluating precision, recall, and F1-scores, with metrics ranging from 0.92 to 1.00 across most classes. Visualized results using confusion matrix and classification reports to address class imbalances and guide improvements.

**Deployment**: Deployed the model using Streamlit, enabling real-time predictions and easy interaction for users in the field.
